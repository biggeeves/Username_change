<p>
    This module's purpose is to help guide you in renaming a username. Modifying a username might pose auditing problems, proceed with care!
    Please proceed with caution.
</p>
It is your responsibility to ensure that new usernames are compliant with REDCap.
Usernames can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and periods.
<p>
    Your database may have inconsistencies with the generated SQL script.
    An example is orphaned data in a child table that stops the SQL script from continuing.
    Information about the database collations and the affected tables is under the "DB Info" tab.
</p>
<p>
    The SQL is generated before any changes are made. Please review all code before proceeding!
    Double and triple check all SQL code before running it.
