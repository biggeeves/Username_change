<p>The purpose of this External Module is to help guide you in renaming a username.
    Modifying a username might pose auditing problems, proceed with care!
</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to triple check the SQL, Tables and Columns used by this External Module.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility to ensure that new usernames are compliant with REDCap.</p>
<p>Usernames can only contain letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, and periods.</p>
<p>Create a backup of your database before continuing. Know how to restore from a backup.</p>
<p>
    Your database may have inconsistencies with the generated SQL script.
    An example is orphaned data in a child table that stops the SQL script from continuing.
    When updating multiple usernames it is possible that a database error stops the script from continuing and all usernames past a certain point are not updated.
    Information about the database collations and the affected tables are under the "Tables" and "DB Info" tab.
</p>
<p>
    You preview the SQL before any changes are made. Review all code before proceeding!
    Double check all SQL code before running it.
