<p>When table based authentication is used passwords are individually salted, hashed and stored in the REDCap database.
    When removing table based authentication, <em>(example: switching from Table Based to OAuth)</em>,
    it may be good idea or even required to remove passwords from REDCap.
    The SQL query below will set all passwords to NULL. Once the SQL script runs, there is no way to recover passwords (other than backups).
    Please use SQL queries as your starting point. If you do not understand what the script will do, do not run it. There is another column,
    password_reset_key, which you may want to set to null as well. This script will work as long as REDCap keeps the password column NULLABLE.

<p style="color:red;"><strong>Running the scripts below will remove ALL passwords, even yours. You may be locked out of the system.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Query 1</strong></p>
<code>UPDATE `redcap_auth` set `password` = NULL</code>
<p><strong>Query 2</strong></p>
<code>UPDATE `redcap_auth` set `password_salt` = NULL</code>
